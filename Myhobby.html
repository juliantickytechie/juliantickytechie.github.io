            <h2>Drawing</h2>
            <p>I think drawing is the best hobby. You can create art anywhere as long as you have two things: pencils and paper. It's good to start at a young age because it gives you a chance to start using your brain and to be creative. Also, it is an opportunity to challenge thinking skills and develop learning skills. A sketch, is a rapidly executed freehand drawing that is not usually intended as a finished work. A sketch may serve a number of purposes: it might record something that the artist sees, it might record or develop an idea for later use or it might be used as a quick way of graphically demonstrating an image, idea or principle. Sketching is the most inexpensive art medium
